    <h2> Indicator descriptions </h2>
    <p>
      GDP per capita index (colored and adjusted size): This indicator shows Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
      adjusted for price changes, per member of the population, indexed to 2007
      Q1=100. Because GDP growth can merely reflect a larger population, it is
      important to account for this when analysing peopleâ€™s material well-being.
      This indicator shows how much real GDP per capita has grown since the
      beginning of 2007 (right before the start of the financial crisis of 2007-2008).
    </p>
    <p>
      Unemployment rate (x-axis): Unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as
      a percentage of the labour force, where the latter consists of the unemployed
      plus those in paid or self-employment. Unemployed people are those who report
      that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have
      taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks. When unemployment is
      high, some people become discouraged and stop looking for work; they are then
      excluded from unemployment and the labour force. This implies that the
      unemployment rate may fall, or stop rising, even though there has been no
      underlying improvement in the labour market. The unemployment rate is an
      important indicator of economic and social well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Labour underutilization rate (y-axis): The broader labour underutilisation rate includes
      in the numerator the unemployed, the marginally attached (i.e. persons not
      in the labour force who did not look for work during the past four weeks
      but who wish and are available to work) and the underemployed (full-time
      workers working less than usual during the survey reference week for
      economic reasons and part-time workers who wanted but could not find
      full-time work), expressed as a ratio of the labour force.
