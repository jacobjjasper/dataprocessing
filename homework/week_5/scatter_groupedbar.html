        <h3 style="">GDP per capita index (colored and adjusted in size)</h3>
        <p>
          GDP per capita index (colored and adjusted size): This indicator shows Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
          adjusted for price changes, per member of the population, indexed to 2007
          Q1=100. Because GDP growth can merely reflect a larger population, it is
          important to account for this when analysing people’s material well-being.
          This indicator shows how much real GDP per capita has grown since the
          beginning of 2007 (right before the start of the financial crisis of 2007-2008).

        <h3>Unemployment rate (x-axis)</h3>
        <p>
          Unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as
          a percentage of the labour force, where the latter consists of the unemployed
          plus those in paid or self-employment. Unemployed people are those who report
          that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have
          taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks. When unemployment is
          high, some people become discouraged and stop looking for work; they are then
          excluded from unemployment and the labour force. This implies that the
          unemployment rate may fall, or stop rising, even though there has been no
          underlying improvement in the labour market. The unemployment rate is an
          important indicator of economic and social well-being.

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Labour underutilization rate (y-axis)</h3>
        <p>
          The broader labour underutilisation rate includes
          in the numerator the unemployed, the marginally attached (i.e. persons not
          in the labour force who did not look for work during the past four weeks
          but who wish and are available to work) and the underemployed (full-time
          workers working less than usual during the survey reference week for
          economic reasons and part-time workers who wanted but could not find
          full-time work), expressed as a ratio of the labour force.

        <h3>Employment rate</h3>
        <p>
          It is the number of employed persons aged 15 to 64 over the population
          of the same age. Employed people are those aged 15 or more who report
          that they have worked in gainful employment for at least one hour in the
          previous week, as defined by the International Labour Organization – ILO.

        <h3>Long-term unemployment rate</h3>
        <p>
          This indicator refers to the number of persons who have been unemployed
          for one year or more as a percentage of the labour force (the sum of
          employed and unemployed persons). Unemployed persons are defined as those
          who are currently not working but are willing to do so and actively
          searching for work.

        <h3>Personal earnings</h3>
        <p>
          This indicator refers to the average annual wages per full-time
          equivalent dependent employee, which are obtained by dividing the
          national-accounts-based total wage bill by the average number of
          employees in the total economy, which is then multiplied by the ratio
          of average usual weekly hours per full-time employee to average usually
          weekly hours for all employees. It considers the employees’ gross
          remuneration, that is, the total before any deductions are made by the
          employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social
          security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and
          other obligations of employees.
