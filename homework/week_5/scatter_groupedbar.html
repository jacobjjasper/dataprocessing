  <h1 class="title"> Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    In 2016, the population of Europe was estimated to be 741 million according to
    the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects[1], which is slightly more
    than one-ninth of the world's population. A century ago, Europe had nearly a
    quarter of the world's population.[217] The population of Europe has grown in
    the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular Africa and Asia)
    the population has grown far more quickly.[218] Among the continents, Europe has
    a relatively high population density, second only to Asia. Most of Europe is in
    a mode of Sub-replacement fertility, which means that each new(-born) generation
    is being less populous than the older. The most densely populated country in
    Europe (and in the world) is the microstate of Monaco.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the
    post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and Slovenia
    adopted them reasonably quickly, while Ukraine and Russia are still in the
    process of doing so.
  </p>
  <p>
    After East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany
    struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East
    Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising
    the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United
    Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU
    joined the Eurozone replacing their former national currencies by the common
    euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United
    Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy
    in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Figures released by Eurostat in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into
    recession in 2008. It impacted much of the region. In 2010, fears of
    a sovereign debt crisis developed concerning some countries in Europe,
    especially Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. As a result, measures
    were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.
    The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012. For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe#Economic_history">(Wikipedia, 2018).</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowing this, how did Europe perform the last few years? And are there any
    differences between men and women? These questions will be answered on this
    website with a scatterplot about the unemployment rate, labour underutilization
    rate and GDP per capita index (2007 = 100) of the years 2015 and 2016. In
    addition, there will be a grouped bargraph available for each country
    (datapoint in the scatterplot) about the employmentrate, the personal earnings
    and the long term unemploymentrate to show the differenes between men and women.

  <h1 class="title"> Storytelling</h1>
  <p> Europe is back in the game. Having suffered the worst financial and economic
      crisis of the last 80 years, Europe took decisive action to improve its public
      finances, push through deep reforms, and establish new institutions to manage
      and prevent crises better. The changes are structural, long-lasting and make
      Europe more competitive. Europe is stronger, better equipped and in the midst
      of ambitious new financial and economic initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The global crisis hit Europe twice. The first strike came from abroad in 2007.
    In the United States, markets had ignored credit risk in subprime mortgage markets.
    A lack of financial supervision allowed opaque financial instruments to flourish,
    aggravating the problem. As a result, the U.S. banking system underwent a dramatic
    bail-out in September 2008. European banks suffered in the fallout. Two years later,
    a second crisis erupted in the euro area. Years of unsustainable government policies
    had caused deficits and debt burdens to mushroom and bloated pre-crisis wages and
    housing prices. As the situation worsened, Europe took courageous decisions to put
    the continent back on firm footing<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/how-the-financial-crisis-made-europe-stronger/"> r(Janse, 2016)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Were these courageous decisions effective on the economic welfare of Europe?
    Is Europe in a better economic state than in 2007? We will analyse this on the
    basis of GDP capita index, unemplotment rate and the labour underutilization rate.
    Because GDP growth can merely reflect a larger population, it is important to
    account for this when analysing people’s material well-being. The unemployment
    rate is an important indicator of economic and social well-being. These indicators
    are a good representation of the welfare in a country. The labour underutilization
    rate will show how much labour is neglected actually. Question which can also
    be asked are "Is employment normally distributed between men en women? And
    are the personal earnings equal? These kind of questions are hot topic these days.
    In 2017 the Euopean Union stated ""
    "
  </p>
  <p>
    These kind of questions are hot topic these days.
    In 2017 the Euopean Union stated "
    We have come a long way in Europe with how we
    ensure equality between women and men. Nevertheless,
    we must be vigilant as we see that many
    gains in this field are being put to the test. In the context of
    persistent economic inequality and rising intolerance – both
    online and in the public sphere – it is essential for the EU
    to reaffirm its strong commitment to gender equality. The
    principle of equality between women and men has been
    enshrined in the EU treaties already since 1957. Since then,
    a lot of progress has been made, women have reaped the
    benefits of education and significantly increased their presence
    on the labour market <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/2017_report_equality_women_men_in_the_eu_en.pdf"> ( European Union, 2017)</a>".
  </p>
  <p>
    But is this really the case? What is the position of women on the labour market
    in the years 2015 and 2016? How big are the differences between men and women
    on the labour market? With the grouped bar chart we analyse the differences of
    the personal earnings between men and women. Also we look at how much men/women
    are actually employed and if they get unemployed, how many people will be
    unemployed on the long term? And is there also a difference between men and women?

        <h3 class="bullets">GDP per capita index (colored and adjusted in size)</h3>
        <p>
          GDP per capita index (colored and adjusted size): This indicator shows Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
          adjusted for price changes, per member of the population, indexed to 2007
          Q1=100. Because GDP growth can merely reflect a larger population, it is
          important to account for this when analysing people’s material well-being.
          This indicator shows how much real GDP per capita has grown since the
          beginning of 2007 (right before the start of the financial crisis of 2007-2008).

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3 class="bullets">Unemployment rate (x-axis)</h3>
        <p>
          Unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as
          a percentage of the labour force, where the latter consists of the unemployed
          plus those in paid or self-employment. Unemployed people are those who report
          that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have
          taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks. When unemployment is
          high, some people become discouraged and stop looking for work; they are then
          excluded from unemployment and the labour force. This implies that the
          unemployment rate may fall, or stop rising, even though there has been no
          underlying improvement in the labour market. The unemployment rate is an
          important indicator of economic and social well-being.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3 class="bullets">Labour underutilization rate (y-axis)</h3>
        <p>
          The broader labour underutilisation rate includes
          in the numerator the unemployed, the marginally attached (i.e. persons not
          in the labour force who did not look for work during the past four weeks
          but who wish and are available to work) and the underemployed (full-time
          workers working less than usual during the survey reference week for
          economic reasons and part-time workers who wanted but could not find
          full-time work), expressed as a ratio of the labour force.

        <p>
          It is the number of employed persons aged 15 to 64 over the population
          of the same age. Employed people are those aged 15 or more who report
          that they have worked in gainful employment for at least one hour in the
          previous week, as defined by the International Labour Organization – ILO.

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3 class="bullets">Long-term unemployment rate</h3>
        <p>
          This indicator refers to the number of persons who have been unemployed
          for one year or more as a percentage of the labour force (the sum of
          employed and unemployed persons). Unemployed persons are defined as those
          who are currently not working but are willing to do so and actively
          searching for work.

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3 class="bullets">Personal earnings</h3>
        <p>
          This indicator refers to the average annual wages per full-time
          equivalent dependent employee, which are obtained by dividing the
          national-accounts-based total wage bill by the average number of
          employees in the total economy, which is then multiplied by the ratio
          of average usual weekly hours per full-time employee to average usually
          weekly hours for all employees. It considers the employees’ gross
          remuneration, that is, the total before any deductions are made by the
          employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social
          security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and
          other obligations of employees.

          <li>  I have chosen the most simple and known color palette. The contrast
                of each color is very clear and the meaning of it speaks for it

            Your Better Life Index aims to involve citizens in the debate on
            measuring the well-being of societies, and to empower them to become
            more informed and engaged in the policy-making process that shapes all
            our lives. Each of the 11 topics of the Index is currently based on one
            to three indicators. Within each topic, the indicators are averaged with
            equal weights. The indicators have been chosen on the basis of a number
            of statistical criteria such as relevance (face-validity, depth, policy
            relevance) and data quality (predictive validity, coverage, timeliness,
            cross-country comparability etc.) and in consultation with OECD member
            countries. These indicators are good measures of the concepts of well-being,
            in particular in the context of a country comparative exercise. Other
            indicators will gradually be added to each topic.
